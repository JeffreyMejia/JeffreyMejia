### About me ðŸ’¬

My name is Jeffrey and I recently made a career change to software development. I'm trying to learn as much as I can and polish up all my skills. I know Typescript, Javascript, Node.js, React, CSS, HTML, and SQL. I'm currently on the job hunt so I can fully start my career path. In the meantime I will be starting a new personal project that will be an improvement of my first project using all the new knowledge I have gained.
